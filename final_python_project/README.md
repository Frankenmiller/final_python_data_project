# final_python_data_project
Final project for New Apprenticeship's IDB10 Data Analysis class

A note on naming conventions used in my project, as much as possible on my own projects I avoid using two-char aliases and always use very descriptive variable names. I've been very explicit in use of commands of what I want interpreter/compiler to do for me, even if it comes across as redundant. Remember that I'm student and am still learning too

Big thanks to McKnight for contribution nifty block of nav code and some coaching when this project still young, looks cool huh. and Thank you to our instructor Steve Franz helping me troubleshoot frustrating patch of code and being our teacher at IDB10 bootcamp, couldn't have built this w/o his coaching we will miss you
